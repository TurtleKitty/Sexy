The Sexy interpreter is written in Chicken Scheme.
You will need this to compile it.

You will also need a number of "eggs".
Once Chicken is in place, the following command should do it:

chicken-install srfi-1 srfi-13 srfi-69 http-client medea numbers openssl posix symbol-utils unix-sockets utf8 utils uuid vector-lib

When run from the root of the git repo:

./bin/compile.sh will compile sexy into an executable
./bin/profile.sh will do the same, but with profiling info attached
./bin/interpret.sh will run the interpreter directly with csi
./bin/run_tests.sh will use the sexy binary to execute everything in ./tests

Have fun! ^_^

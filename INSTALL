The Sexy interpreter is written in Chicken Scheme.
You will need this to compile it.

You will also need a number of "eggs".
Once Chicken is in place, the following command should do it:

chicken-install srfi-1 srfi-13 srfi-69 http-client medea numbers openssl posix symbol-utils utf8 utils uuid vector-lib

./bin/compile.sh will compile sexy into an executable.

./bin/run_tests.sh will use the new binary to execute everything in ./tests.

Have fun! ^_^
